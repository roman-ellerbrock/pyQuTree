# pyQuTree

A smaller python version of the Tree Tensor Network library Qutree[^1]
currently centered around optimization.

Install pyQutree via
```bash
conda env {create, update} --file environment.yml
conda activate qutree
```

You can use a tree tensor network version of cross interpolation[^2] via
```python
from qutree import *

def V(x):
    # change with your objective function
    return np.sum((x-np.ones(x.shape[0]))**2)

N, r, f = 20, 4, 3

objective = Objective(V)

# create a tensor network, e.g. a balanced tree
tn = balanced_tree(f, r, N) 

# Create a primitive grid and tensor network grid
primitive_grid = [linspace(-2., 2., N)] * f

# tensor network optimization
tn_updated = ttnopt(tn, objective, nsweep = 6, primitive_grid)
print(objective)
dataframe = objective.logger.df
print(dataframe)
```
